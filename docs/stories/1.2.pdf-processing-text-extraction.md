# Story 1.2: PDF Processing and Text Extraction

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** teacher,
**I want** to upload a PDF and have the system extract the text content,
**so that** the AI can generate questions based on my curriculum material.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **PDF Upload and Storage** - PDF files are successfully uploaded and stored temporarily in Vercel Blob Storage with proper validation
2. **Text Extraction** - Text content is extracted from PDF using pdf-parse library with comprehensive error handling
3. **Text Processing** - Extracted text is cleaned, normalized, and formatted for optimal AI processing
4. **Real-time Status Updates** - Processing status is displayed to the user with real-time progress indicators during text extraction
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - All PDF processing error scenarios are handled with user-friendly messages and recovery options
6. **Content Validation** - Extracted text is validated for minimum content length and quality to prevent empty or insufficient results
7. **Performance Optimization** - Text extraction completes within 30 seconds for files up to 10MB with proper memory management
8. **Security Compliance** - File processing follows security best practices with proper validation and sanitization

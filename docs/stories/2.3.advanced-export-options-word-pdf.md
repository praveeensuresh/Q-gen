# Story 2.3: Advanced Export Options (Word and PDF)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** teacher,
**I want** to export questions in both Word and PDF formats with professional formatting,
**so that** I can easily integrate the assessments into my existing workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Word (DOCX) export maintains proper formatting and structure
2. PDF export preserves all formatting and is print-ready
3. Export includes metadata (generation date, source document, question count)
4. File naming convention is clear and descriptive
5. Export process handles large question sets efficiently
6. Both formats maintain consistent appearance and readability

- [ ] Implement smart file naming system (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create descriptive naming convention
  - [ ] Add timestamp and version information
  - [ ] Handle special characters and length limits
- [ ] Optimize export performance for large question sets (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement streaming export for large files
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long exports
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage

### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

**Export Metadata (Enhanced):**
```typescript
interface ExportMetadata {
  question_set_id: string;
  document_title: string;
  generated_date: string;
  question_count: number;
  institution_name?: string;
  teacher_name?: string;
  template_used: string;
  export_format: 'pdf' | 'docx';
  file_size: number;
  export_duration: number;
}
```

**Export Configuration:**
```typescript
interface ExportConfig {
  format: 'pdf' | 'docx';
  template_id: string;
  include_metadata: boolean;
  file_naming: {
    pattern: string;
    include_date: boolean;
    include_question_count: boolean;
  };
  quality_settings: {
    pdf_dpi: number;
    docx_compression: boolean;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture.md#api-specification]

**Enhanced Export Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/question-sets/{id}/export` - Advanced export with formatting options
- `GET /api/exports/{id}/status` - Check export status and progress
- `GET /api/exports/{id}/download` - Download completed export

**Advanced Export Request:**
```typescript
interface AdvancedExportRequest {
  format: 'pdf' | 'docx';
  template_id: string;
  config: ExportConfig;
  metadata: ExportMetadata;
  quality_settings?: {
    pdf_dpi?: number;
    docx_compression?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/` for unit tests
- Testing frameworks: Vitest + Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- Unit test coverage: Minimum 85% code coverage for new functionality

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Unit tests for DOCX export functionality
- Unit tests for PDF export functionality
- Unit tests for metadata inclusion
- Integration tests for complete export workflow
- Test both formats with various question sets

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

**Export Libraries:**
- DOCX: docx library with advanced formatting
- PDF: jsPDF or Puppeteer for high-quality output
- File size limits: 100MB maximum for exports
- Supported formats: PDF, DOCX with professional formatting

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
MAX_EXPORT_SIZE=104857600  # 100MB
SUPPORTED_EXPORT_FORMATS=pdf,docx
DEFAULT_PDF_DPI=300
DOCX_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=true
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Export generation should complete within 2 minutes
- Support for up to 200 questions per export
- Efficient memory usage for large question sets
- Streaming export for files over 50MB

**File Storage:**
- Vercel Blob Storage for export files
- Automatic cleanup after 48 hours
- Secure download URLs with 24-hour expiration

### Error Scenarios
[Source: prd-epic2-stories.md#story-23]

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- DOCX Formatting Loss: "Some formatting may be lost in Word export. Please review the document"
- PDF Generation Failure: "Unable to generate PDF. Please try DOCX format or contact support"
- Metadata Missing: "Export metadata is incomplete. Please regenerate questions to include full information"
- File Naming Conflict: "File name already exists. Please choose a different name or the file will be overwritten"
- Large File Export Timeout: "Export is taking longer than expected due to file size. Please wait or try with fewer questions"
- Format Inconsistency: "Export formats may appear different. Please review both formats and choose the best option"
- Export Library Error: "Export service error. Please try again or contact support"
- Memory Insufficient: "Not enough memory to process large export. Please try with fewer questions or contact support"
- Export Validation Failure: "Export validation failed. Please check questions and try again"

## Testing

### Testing Standards

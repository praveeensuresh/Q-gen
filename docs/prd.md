# AI Question Generator Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable teachers to create high-quality assessments in minutes instead of hours
- Provide immediate, ready-to-use question templates for export
- Reduce administrative burden to allow more time for student interaction
- Deliver a functional proof-of-concept that demonstrates the core value proposition

### Background Context
Teachers face significant time pressure in creating student assessments, which diverts valuable time from direct student instruction and progress tracking. The current manual process of reading curriculum documents and writing questions is repetitive and inefficient, leading to less frequent assessments and reduced ability to identify struggling students early. This AI-powered assessment generator addresses this critical need by automating question creation while maintaining quality through professional document templates.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The AI Question Generator should feel like a trusted teaching assistant - simple, reliable, and focused on getting the job done quickly. The interface should minimize cognitive load for busy teachers. The design should convey professionalism and educational expertise, making teachers confident in the quality of generated assessments.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Upload-First Workflow:** The primary user journey starts with file upload, making it immediately clear what the system does
- **Preview-Before-Export:** Teachers can review generated questions before downloading to ensure quality
- **One-Click Actions:** Minimize steps between upload and final output to maximize time savings

### Core Screens and Views
- **Landing/Upload Page** - Main entry point with drag-and-drop file upload
- **Processing Status Page** - Shows progress while AI generates questions
- **Question Preview Page** - Displays generated questions with edit capabilities
- **Export Options Page** - Download interface for Word/PDF formats

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The system should meet WCAG AA standards to ensure all educators can use the tool effectively, including those with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities.

### Branding
Clean, professional educational aesthetic with a focus on readability and trust. Use a color palette that conveys reliability and academic excellence - perhaps deep blues and clean whites with accent colors for interactive elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The system will be web-responsive, optimized for desktop and tablet use, as teachers primarily work on larger screens for curriculum and assessment tasks.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Given the need for rapid development and the single-purpose nature of this application, a monorepo structure will provide better development speed and easier deployment coordination.

### Service Architecture
**Monolith with AI Integration** - A single application that handles file upload, processing, AI integration, and template generation. This architecture supports rapid development while maintaining the ability to scale individual components later if needed.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing** - Unit tests for core business logic (file processing, template generation) and integration tests for AI API calls and file export functionality. This provides confidence in the core functionality without the overhead of full E2E testing for the MVP.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Frontend Framework:** React (as specified in the brief)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI/ChatGPT API for question generation
- **File Processing:** PDF parsing library (e.g., pdf-parse for Node.js)
- **Template Engine:** Markdown processor with placeholder substitution
- **Export Libraries:** Libraries for generating Word (DOCX) and PDF documents
- **File Storage:** Temporary local storage with automatic cleanup
- **Deployment:** Single application deployment (no microservices complexity)
- **Database:** Simple file-based storage or lightweight database (SQLite) for application data
- **Security:** Basic file validation and sanitization for uploaded PDFs

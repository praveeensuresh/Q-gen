# Project Brief: AI Question Generator

## Problem Statement
Teachers are under immense pressure to deliver personalized education, but they are often bogged down by time-consuming administrative tasks. One of the most significant and repetitive tasks is the creation of student assessments, such as quizzes and exams. This manual process is not only slow but also diverts valuable time away from high-impact activities like one-on-one student instruction and analyzing student performance.

The direct impact of this inefficiency is that assessments are created less frequently than is ideal. As a result, teachers struggle to maintain a real-time understanding of student progress, making it difficult to identify and support students who are beginning to fall behind. Existing solutions are often generic, lack customization, or are not seamlessly integrated into a teacher's curriculum workflow. There is a critical need for a tool that dramatically reduces the effort of assessment creation, thereby empowering teachers to track progress more effectively and provide the timely intervention necessary for student success.

## Proposed Solution
We will develop a web application designed as a smart assessment assistant for teachers. The core concept is a streamlined workflow where an educator can upload their existing curriculum documents (in formats like PDF, DOCX, or TXT) and have an AI-powered engine automatically parse the content and generate relevant assessment questions, such as multiple-choice and short-answer questions.

**Key Differentiators:**
Unlike generic AI tools, this solution will have two key differentiators. First, it will output the generated questions into a well-designed, structured template, available for immediate export as a Word document or PDF. This focuses on delivering a ready-to-use end product, not just raw text. Second, it will feature a unique "Super Admin" role with the ability to directly modify the underlying AI prompt used for question generation. This provides an unparalleled level of customization, allowing an institution to fine-tune the output to match its specific pedagogical standards.

This solution is positioned to succeed by directly addressing the core mission we identified: enabling teachers to provide timely support to students. By drastically reducing the friction and time cost of assessment creation, it empowers educators to evaluate their students more frequently, track progress more effectively, and ultimately, intervene when students need it most.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: The Classroom Teacher
* **Profile:** These are K-12 or higher education teachers who are actively involved in curriculum development and student assessment. They are generally tech-comfortable but require intuitive, user-friendly tools that don't have a steep learning curve.
* **Current Workflow:** Their current process involves manually reading curriculum documents and spending significant time writing and formatting questions for quizzes and exams. This is a repetitive task that takes away from time they could be spending on direct student interaction and support.
* **Needs & Pains:** Their primary need is to reclaim time from administrative work. Their pain point is the bottleneck created by manual assessment creation, which limits their ability to frequently test and track student understanding.
* **Goals:** To create high-quality, relevant assessments with minimal effort and to use the time saved to provide more focused, data-driven support to their students.

### Secondary User Segment: The Super Admin
* **Profile:** This user is likely a department head, curriculum director, or technical administrator within a school or district. They are responsible for maintaining academic standards and ensuring the quality of educational tools.
* **Current Workflow:** They oversee curriculum standards and may be involved in approving or providing educational software for their teachers. They are concerned with consistency and quality control.
* **Needs & Pains:** They need to ensure that any AI-generated content aligns with their institution's specific pedagogical style, tone, and standards. Generic AI output may not meet their quality bar or specific curriculum needs.
* **Goals:** To customize and control the logic of the question-generation engine to ensure all assessments created by their teachers are high-quality, consistent, and perfectly aligned with their educational framework.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
* **Primary Objective:** Deliver a complete, functional web application to the client that meets all specified requirements.
* **Secondary Objective:** Optimize the development process for speed to deliver the application as fast as possible.

### User Success Metrics
* **Client Acceptance:** The client formally accepts the delivered application as complete and satisfactory.
* **Functional Completeness:** The application successfully implements all features and acceptance criteria defined in the initial scope.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Project Completion Date:** The date the final application is delivered to and accepted by the client.
* **Scope Delivered:** Percentage of the initially defined features that are completed.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
* **User-Friendly Upload System:** Teachers must be able to upload curriculum files in **PDF format**.
* Content Processing Engine: The system will extract and parse text from the uploaded documents.
* AI Question Generator: An AI engine will create questions (e.g., MCQs, short answers) based on the parsed content.
* Template Output: Generated questions will be formatted into a predefined template for export.
* Export Options: Teachers can download the final, templated questions as a Word document (DOCX) or PDF.
* Super Admin Functionality: A Super Admin login will be available to modify the core AI prompt used for question generation.
* Error Handling: The system will provide clear error messages for invalid or unreadable file uploads.

### Out of Scope for MVP
* **Support for uploading other document formats like DOCX and TXT.**
* Advanced analytics on question effectiveness or student performance.
* Direct integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Canvas or Moodle.
* A user-managed library for storing and reusing uploaded documents or generated question sets.
* Multiple user roles beyond "Teacher" and "Super Admin."

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP will be considered a success upon delivery to the client and their formal acceptance that it meets all the core features defined above.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
* Integration with major Learning Management Systems (LMS).
* Analytics dashboard for teachers to see which questions students struggle with.
* Support for a wider range of document types and multimedia content.
* Ability for teachers to save and organize their generated assessments in an online library.

### Long-term Vision
The long-term vision is to create a smart assessment partner for educators that not only saves time but actively helps improve student learning outcomes by providing data-driven insights.

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Preferences
* **Frontend:** React.
* **Backend:** To be determined by the Architect, focusing on rapid development and reliable AI integration.
* **Database:** To be determined by the Architect.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
* **Timeline:** The primary constraint is the speed of delivery. The project must be completed as fast as possible.
* **Frontend Technology:** The frontend must be developed using React.

### Key Assumptions
* The client will provide the necessary API keys for the AI engine (e.g., OpenAI/ChatGPT).
* The client will provide the specific "predefined templates" for the question document outputs.
* The initial version will focus on English-language documents only.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
* **AI Quality:** The quality and relevance of the AI-generated questions may require significant prompt engineering and tuning by the Super Admin.
* **Document Parsing:** Complex PDF layouts or poorly scanned documents may result in text extraction errors.

### Open Questions
* What is the client's target deadline for delivery?
* What are the specific formatting requirements for the Word and PDF output templates?
* Are there any specific data privacy or security standards (like FERPA) that need to be followed?

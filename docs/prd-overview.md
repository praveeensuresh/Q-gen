# AI Question Generator - PRD Overview & Goals

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable teachers to create high-quality assessments in minutes instead of hours
- Provide immediate, ready-to-use question templates for export
- Reduce administrative burden to allow more time for student interaction
- Deliver a functional proof-of-concept that demonstrates the core value proposition

### Background Context
Teachers face significant time pressure in creating student assessments, which diverts valuable time from direct student instruction and progress tracking. The current manual process of reading curriculum documents and writing questions is repetitive and inefficient, leading to less frequent assessments and reduced ability to identify struggling students early. This AI-powered assessment generator addresses this critical need by automating question creation while maintaining quality through professional document templates.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
**@ux-expert.mdc** - Please review the AI Question Generator PRD and create the user experience architecture. Focus on the upload-first workflow and question preview interface. The system needs to feel like a trusted teaching assistant with minimal cognitive load for busy teachers.

### Architect Prompt
**@architect.mdc** - Please review the AI Question Generator PRD and create the technical architecture. Key focus areas: React frontend with PDF processing, AI integration (OpenAI), and template engine with Markdown support. Architecture should support rapid development with a monolith approach while maintaining scalability options.

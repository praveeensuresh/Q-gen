# AI Question Generator - Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish project setup, basic file upload, and AI integration to deliver a working proof-of-concept that can process a PDF and generate questions. This epic creates the foundational infrastructure while delivering immediate value through a functional PDF-to-questions pipeline that demonstrates the core concept.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic React Application

As a **developer**,
I want **a basic React application with routing and file upload interface**,
so that **we have a foundation to build the AI question generator upon**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. React application is created with modern tooling (Vite or Create React App)
2. Basic routing is implemented for main pages (Upload, Processing, Preview, Export)
3. File upload component accepts PDF files with drag-and-drop functionality
4. File validation ensures only PDF files are accepted
5. Basic error handling displays user-friendly messages for invalid files
6. Application is deployable to a development environment

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Invalid File Type:** Display clear error message "Please upload a PDF file only" with file type requirements
- **File Too Large:** Show error "File size exceeds 10MB limit" with size reduction suggestions
- **Network Upload Failure:** Display "Upload failed. Please check your connection and try again" with retry button
- **Browser Compatibility:** Show warning for unsupported browsers with recommended alternatives
- **JavaScript Disabled:** Display fallback message with instructions to enable JavaScript
- **Route Navigation Errors:** Show 404 page with navigation back to main upload page
- **Component Loading Failures:** Display error boundary with "Something went wrong" and reload option

**Technical Tasks:**
- Set up React project with Vite
- Install and configure Material UI components
- Implement React Router for navigation
- Create file upload component with drag-and-drop

## Story 1.2: PDF Processing and Text Extraction

As a **teacher**,
I want **to upload a PDF and have the system extract the text content**,
so that **the AI can generate questions based on my curriculum material**.

1. PDF files are successfully uploaded and stored temporarily
2. Text content is extracted from PDF using a reliable parsing library
3. Extracted text is cleaned and formatted for AI processing
4. Processing status is displayed to the user during text extraction
5. Error handling manages corrupted or unreadable PDF files
6. Extracted text is validated for minimum content length (prevents empty results)

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Corrupted PDF:** Display "PDF file appears to be corrupted. Please try a different file" with file validation tips
- **Password-Protected PDF:** Show "This PDF is password-protected. Please provide an unprotected version" with instructions
- **Image-Only PDF:** Display "PDF contains only images. Please use a text-based PDF for better results" with OCR suggestion
- **Empty PDF:** Show "PDF appears to be empty or contains no readable text" with content requirements
- **Processing Timeout:** Display "PDF processing is taking longer than expected. Please wait or try a smaller file" with progress indicator
- **Storage Failure:** Show "Unable to store file temporarily. Please try again" with retry option
- **Text Extraction Failure:** Display "Unable to extract text from PDF. Please ensure the file is not corrupted" with troubleshooting steps
- **Insufficient Text:** Show "Extracted text is too short for question generation. Please use a longer document" with minimum length requirements

**Technical Tasks:**
- Implement PDF upload endpoint
- Integrate pdf-parse library for text extraction
- Add text cleaning and formatting logic
- Create processing status UI component
- Implement error handling for PDF processing
- Add text validation for minimum content length
- Set up temporary file storage with cleanup

## Story 1.3: AI Integration and Basic Question Generation

2. Basic prompt template generates multiple-choice and short-answer questions
3. Generated questions are displayed in a readable format
4. AI responses are parsed and structured for display
5. Error handling manages API failures and rate limiting
6. Generated content is validated for quality and relevance

**Error Scenarios:**

- **API Timeout:** Display "AI processing is taking longer than expected. Please try again" with retry option
- **API Service Unavailable:** Show "AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later" with status page link
- **Invalid AI Response:** Display "Unable to process AI response. Please try generating questions again" with retry button
- **Insufficient Content:** Show "Content is too short for question generation. Please use a longer document" with minimum requirements
- **Inappropriate Content:** Display "Content may not be suitable for educational use. Please review and try again" with content guidelines
- **Network Connection Lost:** Show "Connection lost during AI processing. Please check your internet and try again" with retry option
- **Malformed Questions:** Display "Some questions could not be generated properly. Please try again" with partial results shown

**Technical Tasks:**
- Set up OpenAI API integration
- Implement secure API key management
- Create basic prompt templates for question generation
- Add AI response parsing and structuring
- Implement error handling for API failures
- Create question display components
- Add content validation logic

## Story 1.4: Basic Template and Export Functionality

As a **teacher**,
I want **to export generated questions in a basic format**,
so that **I can use the questions in my teaching immediately**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Basic template structure formats questions consistently
2. Questions are numbered and organized by type (MCQ, Short Answer)
3. Export functionality generates a downloadable file (PDF or DOCX)
4. Template includes basic formatting (headers, question numbering)
5. Export process handles errors gracefully
6. Generated file is properly formatted and readable

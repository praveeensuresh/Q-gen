### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None identified

**HIGH:** 
- Data schema and relationships need more detail for Epic 1 implementation
- Integration testing requirements could be more specific

**MEDIUM:**
- User research validation could be strengthened with more specific metrics
- Performance monitoring approach could be more detailed

**LOW:**
- Additional visual diagrams could enhance clarity
- More specific error message examples could be helpful

### MVP Scope Assessment
- **Scope is appropriate** - covers core teacher workflow without over-engineering
- **Epic sequencing is logical** - each epic delivers value while building foundation
- **Stories are well-sized** - appropriate for AI agent execution
- **Timeline appears realistic** - 3 epics with focused scope

### Technical Readiness
- **Technical constraints are clear** - React frontend, monolith architecture specified
- **AI integration approach is defined** - OpenAI API with proper key management
- **File processing strategy is outlined** - PDF parsing with error handling
- **Areas for architect investigation:** Specific AI prompt engineering, template engine implementation

### Recommendations
1. **Proceed to architecture phase** - PRD is comprehensive and ready
2. **Architect should focus on:** Data schema design, AI prompt structure, template engine architecture
3. **Consider adding:** More specific performance monitoring requirements during development

### Final Decision
**READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.

## Sharded Document Structure

The PRD has been successfully sharded into the following focused documents:

### 1. PRD Overview & Goals (`prd-overview.md`)
- Project goals and background context
- Epic list and high-level scope
- Next steps and expert prompts

### 2. Requirements Specification (`prd-requirements.md`)
- Functional requirements (FR1-FR9)
- Non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR6)
- Cross-functional requirements including data schema, integration, security, and performance

### 3. UI/UX Design Goals (`prd-ui-ux-goals.md`)
- Overall UX vision and interaction paradigms
- Core screens and accessibility requirements
- User experience requirements and usability principles

### 4. Technical Assumptions (`prd-technical-assumptions.md`)
- Repository structure and service architecture
- Technology stack decisions
- Development tools and deployment considerations

### 5. Epic 1 Stories (`prd-epic1-stories.md`)
- Foundation & Core Infrastructure epic
- Four detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Technical tasks and dependencies

### 6. Epic 2 Stories (`prd-epic2-stories.md`)
- Question Generation & Template System epic
- Five detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Advanced functionality and user experience improvements

### 7. Quality Assessment (`prd-quality-assessment.md`)
- PRD completeness analysis
- Risk assessment and recommendations
- Document structure overview

## Benefits of Sharding

### Improved Focus
- Each document focuses on a specific aspect of the project
- Easier to navigate and find relevant information
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific areas

### Parallel Development
- Different team members can work on different aspects simultaneously
- UX expert can focus on UI/UX goals while architect works on technical assumptions
- Developers can reference specific story documents during implementation

### Maintenance
- Updates to specific areas don't require editing large documents
- Version control is more granular
- Easier to track changes and updates

### Collaboration
- Stakeholders can focus on relevant documents
- Easier to share specific sections with external reviewers
- Clear separation of concerns for different roles

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **UX Expert Review:** Focus on `prd-ui-ux-goals.md` for user experience architecture
2. **Architect Review:** Focus on `prd-technical-assumptions.md` and `prd-requirements.md` for technical architecture
3. **Development Planning:** Use `prd-epic1-stories.md` for initial development sprint planning

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Update individual documents as requirements evolve
- Maintain cross-references between documents
- Regular review of document consistency
- Version control for each sharded document

### Success Metrics
- Each document should be independently useful
- Clear navigation between related documents
- Consistent terminology and formatting across all documents
- Regular validation that sharded documents remain comprehensive

# AI Question Generator - UI/UX Design Goals

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The AI Question Generator should feel like a trusted teaching assistant - simple, reliable, and focused on getting the job done quickly. The interface should minimize cognitive load for busy teachers. The design should convey professionalism and educational expertise, making teachers confident in the quality of generated assessments.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Upload-First Workflow:** The primary user journey starts with file upload, making it immediately clear what the system does
- **Preview-Before-Export:** Teachers can review generated questions before downloading to ensure quality
- **One-Click Actions:** Minimize steps between upload and final output to maximize time savings

### Core Screens and Views
- **Landing/Upload Page** - Main entry point with drag-and-drop file upload
- **Processing Status Page** - Shows progress while AI generates questions
- **Question Preview Page** - Displays generated questions with edit capabilities
- **Export Options Page** - Download interface for Word/PDF formats

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The system should meet WCAG AA standards to ensure all educators can use the tool effectively, including those with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities.

### Branding
Clean, professional educational aesthetic with a focus on readability and trust. Use a color palette that conveys reliability and academic excellence - perhaps deep blues and clean whites with accent colors for interactive elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The system will be web-responsive, optimized for desktop and tablet use, as teachers primarily work on larger screens for curriculum and assessment tasks.

## User Experience Requirements

### Primary User Journey
1. **Upload:** Teacher drags and drops PDF curriculum document
2. **Process:** System shows progress while extracting text and generating questions
3. **Preview:** Teacher reviews generated questions and makes edits if needed
4. **Export:** Teacher downloads questions in preferred format (Word/PDF)

### Error Handling and Feedback
- **Clear Error Messages:** Explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Processing Status:** Show progress during AI generation with estimated time
- **Validation Feedback:** Immediate feedback on file format and size issues
- **Success Confirmation:** Clear confirmation when questions are ready

### Usability Principles
- **Minimal Learning Curve:** Teachers should be able to use the system without training

### Performance Expectations
- **Fast Upload:** File upload should feel immediate with progress indication

- **Fast Export:** Download should start immediately when requested

### Mobile and Tablet Considerations
- **Touch-Friendly:** Large touch targets for mobile and tablet interaction
